# PD-Denoising-using-Optimized-Wavelet
## *Partial Discharge Denoising Using Optimized Wavelet-Based Technique*

Note: Project repository has yet to be updated. Work in progress

- ***MainFunction.ipynb*** runs all three parts/steps of the denoising technique [listed below].
- ***Preprocessing.ipynb*** performs preprocessing of the PD signal; extracting PD pulses & outputting clean & noisy signals
- ***NSGA2.ipynb*** performs the NSGA2 optimization to determine the best wavelet denoising parameters.
- ***Denoising.ipynb*** performs the optimized wavelet denoising on the noise-contaminated PD pulses.
